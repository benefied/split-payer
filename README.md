# split-payer
a contract i and a friend created with a friend for learning how to split ether and deploy
The aim of this contract was to create a consensus payment system so that when we get a payment instance for a job we both did and want to split the payment we can send this contract address so that the ethers is sent here and split equally
Security measures will be taken this week

for the frontend it would be designed like a wallet which and also the solidity code will record past transactions to display in the frontend
Since Im learning reactjs ill implement reactjs to the frontend to give flexibility
